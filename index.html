      <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing
         a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
         Python doesn't directly support paragraph-oriented file reading, but, as usual, it's not hard to add such functionality. We define a paragraph as a string formed by joining a nonempty sequence of nonseparator lines, separated from any adjoining paragraphs by nonempty sequences of separator lines.
         C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language. A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the Internet.
